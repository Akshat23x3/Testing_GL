## A work in Progress Project.

### A real-time 3D Rendering Engine which is developed for the sole purpose of Fun and Curiosity. I have no intentions as of now to release this engine in the market. But would surely like to work in collaboration for the development of this Engine.
 

## Developments made While Still in Development : 

---

### This Engine uses one of the most powerful graphics render library OPENGL 6.0 which is an open graphics library. By the use of robust OOPS concept, I was able to achieve multiple object of multiple classes in an efficient way. To efficiently observe models, an open world was implemented to achive dextarity, The open world can be a plain background or can be replaced by a skybox depending on the end/user. For implementing models, [ASSIMP](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) library which is a library to import and export various 3d-model-formats including scene-post-processing to generate missing render data.

### Engine also supports multiple model and mesh imports.

Models can be moved and transformed in all three axes(X,Y,Z). Transformations like Scaling, Rotating and Moving.

## Lighting

---

Engine Supports all three types of lighting Direction, Point and Spot light. To render a point light engine has an available mesh as a cube to which radiates light and can be used as a point light.
